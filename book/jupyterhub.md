# JupyterHub for class

In doing your work, you will need a python3 environment with several libraries installed. To streamline this, we created a JupyterHub instance with the necessary environment pre-installed. We will use this JupyterHub for some homework assignments that are graded with `nbgrader`. Below are the links to the

Please give it a try and let us know how it works for you

 ```{tip}
Course material will be put in the `shared` folder, which is read-only. You will need to copy the files to your home area to modify them. 
 ```


```{tip}
If you prefer the Jupyter Lab interface over the classic notebook, change the last part of the URL to "lab", e.g. [https://physga-2059-fall.rcnyu.org/user/<netid>/lab/](https://physga-2059-fall.rcnyu.org/user/<netid>/lab/) (and replace `<netid>` with your netid)
```


```{tip}
The server will shutdown after 15 min of inactivity or (3 hours hard time limit). If you know you are done, click `Control Panel` in the top right and shutdown your server.
```


## Changing Kernels 

 ```{tip}
The default environment (kernel) is `Python 3`, you will need to change it to `Python [conda env:course]` to pick up the right environment with the installed libraries.
